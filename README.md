Java 8 Basics and Collections

•	A TreeSet uses compareTo(Object o) method implementation from Comparable<T> interface to check for both duplicate elements as well as for sorting.
  
•	A HashSet uses hashCode() and equals(Object o) method to  check for duplicates

•	From Java 8 onwards,Streams provide an efficient way to iterate over collections and for large data sets,parallel streams can be used for processing collections.

•	For using a custom entity with collections,it is best practice to:
     
     1)Override hashCode() and equals(Object o) methods
     
     2)Implement Comparable<T> interface,providing implementation for compareTo(Object  o) method
