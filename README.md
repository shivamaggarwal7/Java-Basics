Java 8 Basics and Collections

•	A TreeSet uses compareTo(Object o) method implementation from Comparable<T> interface to check for both duplicate elements as well as for sorting.
•	A HashSet uses hashCode() and equals(Object o) method to  check for duplicates
•	From Java 8 onwards,Streams provide an efficient way to iterate over collections and for large data sets,parallel streams can be used for processing collections.
